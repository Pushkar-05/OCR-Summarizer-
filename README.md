## OCR and Text Summarization Tool - Free and Open to All

I recently built a lightweight, open-source OCR and text summarization tool in Python that extracts text from images and generates concise summaries. This project is now fully open to the community under the MIT license. Feel free to use, modify, and improve it!

### What This Tool Does
- **Extracts Text from Images** – Uses Tesseract OCR to convert image-based text into readable content.
- **Summarizes Extracted Text** – Leverages Hugging Face's "facebook/bart-large-cnn" model to generate concise summaries.
- **Simple and Fast** – Requires minimal setup and works directly in Google Colab.

### Technologies Used
- **OpenCV (cv2)** – Image processing (Apache 2.0 License)
- **pytesseract** – Tesseract OCR wrapper (Apache 2.0 License)
- **transformers** – Hugging Face NLP library (Apache 2.0 License)
- **facebook/bart-large-cnn** – Pre-trained summarization model by Meta AI (Apache 2.0 License)

### How to Use
1. Clone or download the code.
2. Upload an image to Google Colab.
3. Update the image path and run the script.



### Why This Matters
This project is a simple demonstration of how AI and machine learning can automate routine tasks, such as reading and summarizing documents. It is fully open-source, enabling anyone to learn from or extend the project.

### License and Availability
- **License**: MIT – Free for personal and commercial use.
- **Dependencies**: Apache 2.0 License (OpenCV, pytesseract, transformers, and Meta AI models)

### Get Involved
Feel free to fork the project, suggest improvements, or contribute to the codebase. Let's collaborate and build more useful tools together. Share this with your network or use it in your own projects!
